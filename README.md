## 🧭 What I build
I work on projects that move from data ingestion → exploration → modeling → deployment. I like to make my work:
- Reproducible (versioning, notebooks → scripts, containers)
- Interpretable (model explanations, clear metrics)
- Useful (focus on actionable insights and impact)

Pinned project ideas (replace with your repos):
- 📊 Predictive analytics pipelines — end-to-end model training + deployment
- 🧾 NLP tools — document classification, extractive summarization
- ⏱️ Time-series forecasting — robust backtesting + feature stores

Want me to pin specific projects here? I can auto-generate the project cards for your repos.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (short)
- Languages: Python, SQL, R (familiar)
- ML & Libraries: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Data: pandas, NumPy, SQL, Airflow (ETL ideas)
- Tools: Jupyter, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, MLflow (experiments + tracking)
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, dashboards

---

## 📚 Currently Learning
- Productionizing ML models (MLOps patterns)
- Advanced deep learning architectures for NLP & vision
- Building more robust model explainability layers (SHAP/LIME + custom)

## 🎯 Quick Tips to make this README even cooler
- Add a short GIF or hero image showcasing a project in action.
- Replace the "Pinned project ideas" with markdown badges linking directly to your repo pages:
  - Example: [![Project Name](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Name-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/269Nikhil/project-name)
- Add a "Featured Notebooks" section linking to your Jupyter notebooks or Google Colab demos.
- Show a "Where to start" section for visitors who want to explore your best repos first.

## 💡 Fun fact
I love turning messy datasets into clean dashboards — it's like solving a puzzle where every piece helps tell a better story.

---

If you'd like, I can:
- Auto-generate a "Projects" section with live repo links from your account,
- Add a custom hero banner (SVG/PNG) with your name and a data-science themed illustration,
- Or create a short "About me" video GIF to embed.

Tell me which of these you'd like and I’ll update this README accordingly.
